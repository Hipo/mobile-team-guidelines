# Weekly Huddle Etiquette

This chapter outlines overall recommendations for our weekly mobile huddles.

### Huddle Should Be Held Every Week

As long as there are at least 4 people who can attend, huddle should be held that week, regardless of who can join and who cannot. Busy project schedules should not be a reason for skipping the huddle.

### Not Just Links

Huddles should be our weekly rallying points to discuss implementation details, weird bugs or issues we couldn't resolve. Content can always be supplemented with interesting articles or libraries, but our internal communication has top priority.
